# Developer's Guideline

This document describes how you can add your own optimization function to TIDL ONNX Model Optimizer library.


## Creating a function
You have to write a function that contains the optimization you are intending to do.

### Prototype

`def tidl_abc ( graph: gs.Graph, onnx_graph: onnx.GraphProto):`

`abc` should clearly describe what the function is doing in brief. For e.g., `tidl_convert_resize_params_size_to_scale` is name of the function that changes the sizes input of a Resize layer to appropriate scales.

### Where to put your function
In the following section, changes have to be made inside `tidl_onnx_model_optimizer/src` directory.

#### Case - I
If you are writing a function which handles a layer/block which is already present, you are expected to keep the function in the .py file existing for that layer/block. For e.g., if you are adding a optimization function on resize layer, you are supposed to put `tidl_abc` function in `resize.py`.

In this case you will require to add the function call to the wrapper function present in the .py file. For e.g., in `resize.py` you will have to add the call to `tidl_abc{...)}` call inside `tidl_modify_resize` wrapper function. You will have to add under the conditional flag `args['abc']` which will be added in the interface. Please add logging debug prints to indicate triggering of this specific function. For logging print formats, please refer to existing prints.

#### Case - II
If you are creating a function for a completely new layer/block, you will have to create a new .py file, which should be named as `<layer>.py` or `<block>.py`. Every such .py file will have a wrapper global function as the first function :

`def tidl_modify_<layer/block> (graph: gs.Graph, onnx_graph: onnx.GraphProto, args: dict):`

Once you create this wrapper function, please add your own specific optimization function as mentioned in Case-I.


## Interface
Make the following changes in the file `tidl_onnx_model_optimizer/optimize.py`

### Control Flag
You will require a new flag for enable/disbale control over your optimization. For that purpose you have to change the dict returned in the function `get_optimizers` to have a new entry `'abc'`. You can make the default value here True/False as per your need.

### Call to implemented function
Finally you need to change the dict variable `opt_ops` if you have added a new .py file.
Add a entry `"<layer/block>" : tidl_modify_<layer/block>` and voila! You are done.


## Good Practices
For good practices ensure to use the logging library facility and add useful debug logs wherever you seem necessary ðŸ™‚.
Also please try to run pylint on the code as this codebase has been developed with pylint coding guidelines. If you are using pylint in your VS Code, you can add these settings to ensure consistency:
```
"pylint.args": [
        "--disable=E1101,W0613,W1203,E0401,W1201,W1514",
        "--max-line-length=160"
    ],
```
